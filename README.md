Introduction
========================
This modules are intended as a cheap replacement for the Wago 24V digital inputs and digital outputs that are typically used with the Calaos (https://calaos.fr/) domotic system (illustration here: https://calaos.fr/wiki/fr/quatro)

Purpose of these modules
========================
The "32 inputs" module is to be connected to contact switches operating at 24V level. The switches can be wired using telephone SYT cable (AWG20 or AWG24). (Illustration here: https://calaos.fr/wiki/fr/prerequis).

The "32 outputs" module is to be connected to relays controlling the house. For example Wago 788-304.
The outputs are NPN-type, this means they must be connected to the 0V side of the relay coil. The 24V side of the relay coil is always powered.
